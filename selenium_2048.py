# 2048 is a simple game where you combine tiles by sliding them up, down,
# left, or right with the arrow keys. You can actually get a fairly high score
# by repeatedly sliding in an up, right, down, and left pattern over and over
# again. Write a program that will open the game at https://gabrielecirulliâ€‹
# .github.io/2048/ and keep sending up, right, down, and left keystrokes to
# automatically play the game.
