# Say you have an encrypted PDF that you have forgotten the password to,
# but you remember it was a single English word. Trying to guess your forgot-
# ten password is quite a boring task. Instead you can write a program that
# will decrypt the PDF by trying every possible English word until it finds one
# that works. This is called a brute-force password attack. Download the text file
# dictionary.txt from https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2/. This dictionary file con-
# tains over 44,000 English words with one word per line.
# Using the file-reading skills you learned in Chapter 9, create a list of
# word strings by reading this file. Then loop over each word in this list, pass-
# ing it to the decrypt() method. If this method returns the integer 0, the pass-
# word was wrong and your program should continue to the next password.
# If decrypt() returns 1, then your program should break out of the loop and
# print the hacked password. You should try both the uppercase and lower-
# case form of each word. (On my laptop, going through all 88,000 uppercase
# and lowercase words from the dictionary file takes a couple of minutes. This
# is why you shouldnâ€™t use a simple English word for your passwords.)
